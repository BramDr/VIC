# Variable Infiltration Capacity Lake (VIC-LAKE) Model

----------

This repository serves as the public source code repository of the **Variable Infiltration Capacity Lake Model**, better known as **VIC-LAKE**. VIC-LAKE is a modified version of the VIC model, which is used to run the lake module isolated from the VIC model (to improve performance). The model is undocumented and no support is given. VIC documentation can be read on the [VIC documentation website](http://vic.readthedocs.org).

If you make use of this model, please acknowledge Bowling and Lettenmaier (2010), Hostetler and Bartlein (1990), Hostetler (1991), and Hostetler et al. (2000).
